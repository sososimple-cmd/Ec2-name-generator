EC2 Random Name Generator
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

This is a simple Python script that helps you generate unique names for AWS EC2 instances. Itâ€™s designed to make life easier for teams by combining department names with random letters and numbers.

What Does It Do?
The script asks for:

How many EC2 instances you need names for.
Your department (e.g., Marketing, Accounting, or FinOps).
It then generates unique names like this:



1 Accounting-QWE9101
2 Accounting-LMN5678
3 Accounting-XYZ1234


Only authorized departments can use the generator, so make sure you enter the department name correctly!

How to Use It
Run the script:
bash


1
python ec2_name_generator.py
Follow the prompts:
Enter the number of EC2 instances you need names for.
Type in your department (e.g., Marketing, Accounting, or FinOps).
Thatâ€™s it! The script will print out the unique names for your EC2 instances.
Why Use This?
It saves time by generating unique names automatically.
It ensures consistency by using your department name in every instance.
Itâ€™s beginner-friendly and easy to use.
